# Data Science Nigeria Comedy Rating Prediction

A new Abuja-based online Comedy TV is seeking to optimise its content using customer ratings. Its contents are bought from popular comedy shows that are held in different parts of Nigeria. Therefore it is important for the company to understand which content makes business sense based on customer rating.
In addition, it desires to offer personalised experience to each online viewer by delivering best comedy content that are most relevant to each viewer in its growing community of online and offline followers.

You have been appointed as the Lead Data Analyst to predict the ratings for some comedy events per individual based on the ratings by the same users for another set of comedy. This will inform its recommendation system.

The dataset contains anonymous ratings between -5 and 5 provided by followers of this comedy online station. Given the combination of user and comedy event, your task is to predict the rating given by that user to other comedy in the test set.
